1. Folder Structure

The project must have two separate folders for clear separation of concerns:

project-root/
  frontend/   â†’ React + Vite + Tailwind CSS
  backend/    â†’ FastAPI (Python)


frontend/ handles UI and user interactions.

backend/ handles API requests, Firebase integration, and database operations.

Unnecessary files should be removed, and the structure must be clean, minimal, and deployable.

2. Responsibilities
ðŸŸ¢ Frontend (frontend/)

Built with React (Vite) and Tailwind CSS.

Handles user-facing pages (login, signup, dashboard).

Authenticates users via Firebase Authentication (email/password or other providers).

Sends authenticated requests to the FastAPI backend with Firebase token.

Displays patients and practitioners list/details fetched from backend APIs.

ðŸ”µ Backend (backend/)

Built with FastAPI (Python).

Exposes REST APIs for authentication verification and database operations.

Must verify Firebase JWT tokens for secure requests.

Handles saving and retrieving patient and practitioner details in Firebase Firestore Database.

Example API routes:

POST /signup â†’ Register new user and store basic profile data in Firestore

POST /login â†’ Verify Firebase token from frontend

POST /patients â†’ Add patient details to Firestore

GET /patients â†’ Fetch all patients from Firestore

POST /practitioners â†’ Add practitioner details to Firestore

GET /practitioners â†’ Fetch all practitioners from Firestore

3. Deployment

Frontend: Deployable on Vercel or Netlify.

Backend: Deployable on Render, Railway, Fly.io, or any FastAPI-supported service.

4. Deliverables

Clean frontend + backend folder structure with minimal boilerplate.

Firebase integration for authentication and Firestore database.

FastAPI backend APIs for handling patients & practitioners (save + fetch).

React pages: Login, Signup, Dashboard showing lists from backend.

âœ… Final Goal: A clean full-stack project where the frontend handles Firebase authentication, while the backend manages Firebase Firestore database (patients & practitioners) and exposes APIs for the frontend to consume.
